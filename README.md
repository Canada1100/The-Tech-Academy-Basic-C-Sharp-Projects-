# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

This repository contains the collection of basic C# programming projects that I completed as part of The Tech Academy's Basic C# course. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning progress and the foundational skills I've acquired in C# development.

As I progress through the coursework and build more projects, this repository will be updated to reflect my growing abilities and the different concepts covered in the curriculum. This will serve as a valuable resource for demonstrating my skills and understanding to potential employers or collaborators in the future.
